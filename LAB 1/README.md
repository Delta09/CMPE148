##TCP Protocol
1. To simulate the TCP/IP open 2 instances of your command line terminal and navigate to the folder where TCP_Server.py and TCP_Client.py is located.
2.  In one instance of your terminal run the following command:
`python TCP_Server.py`
on the other run:
`python TCP_Client.py`
3. In the client terminal you will be prompted to "Enter a Number:". In the server terminal a message will appear indicating you have connection to (HOST, PORT).
4. In the client terminal enter your desired number and press enter. Enter 24.
5. The server terminal will display a message indicating that it received the number '24' from the client.
6. The client terminal will then display a message received from the server indicating that "24 is not a prime number".


##UDP Protocol
1. To simulate the UDP over IP open 2 instances of your command line terminal and navigate to the folder where UDP_Server.py and UDP_Client.py is located.
2.  In one instance of your terminal run the following command:
`python UDP_Server.py`
on the other run:
`python UDP_Client.py`
3. In the client terminal you will be prompted to "Enter a Number:". In the server terminal a message will appear indicating you have connection to (HOST, PORT).
4. In the client terminal enter your desired number and press enter. Enter 173.
5. The server terminal will display a message indicating that it received the number '173' from the client.
